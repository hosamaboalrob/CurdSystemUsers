In this project, I developed a website for entering, displaying, and updating employee and user information, utilizing local storage for data management. The site features a user-friendly interface where administrators can input new employee/user data, view existing records, and update information as needed. Data is stored locally on the user's device, ensuring privacy and accessibility. The project emphasizes seamless data manipulation and efficient user interaction to streamline the management of employee and user information.
